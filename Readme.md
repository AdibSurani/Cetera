# Cetera
Yet another random toolkit for 3DS files.

The primary aim is not to provide another command-line converter/packer/dumper/injector, but rather a lightweight library which makes it easy for people to write programs to modify these files to suit their needs.

The current messy state of affairs is intended to show that most of it is not ready for general use.

TestAppForm is provided as a (terrible) means of testing some of these formats.
